Notes
- Unsplash images are free under the Unsplash license. Attribution is appreciated but not required.
- After running the download script, the homepage will use the local files at `/images/team-1.jpg`, etc.
- If you want me to pick specific photos or replace placeholders with branded logos, tell me which source you prefer (Unsplash, Pexels, or provide assets).
